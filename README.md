# TVPadFirmware

This is a filesystem dump image of a TVPad M120 set-top box from sketchy Chinese Company Create New Technology.  
The hardware is simple - Telechips TCC8900, ARM Mali200 GPU, 256GB of RAM, 2GB of Flash (similar to the original Raspberry Pi A)
This is a generation 1 box claiming to be an Android 2.3.4 machine.   It's not, it's a Kernel 2.6.28 machine with libc (not bionic)
and no Dalvik (so it would never run the Android binaries.  The machine is a bit of a mess, but it does lend itself useful as a 
snapshot to how set-top boxes work, and what makes this stuff tick.
